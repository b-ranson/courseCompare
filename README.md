# COURSECOMPARE

### Problem To Solve

We want to implement a way for FSU Students to be able to view and compare their schedule to their peers. We also have included a review system for courses so students can view and prepare for future classes based on reviews. This project is a spin off of RateMyProfessor with a social media aspect and basing the site more on courses rather than professors.

### Extra UI Details to Know

### Libraries Being Used
- Django framework
- MySQL
### Other Resources
- N/A
### Extra Features Implemented Beyond Proposal
- We added the professor rating option from our optional ideas in our proposal to our project, as it was relatively simple
to implement.
### Features From Proposal We Did Not Implement
-  We did not add any functionality to see aspects like grade weight or GPA for in-class assignments as this
varies too much from class to class and would be challenging to implement in a scalable way. We also elected to
make every account on our platorm be viewable by other users instead of implementing a graph-based friends list.
