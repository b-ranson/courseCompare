# COURSECOMPARE

### Problem To Solve

We want to implement a way for FSU Students to be able to view and compare their schedule to their peers. We also have included a review system for courses so students can view and prepare for future classes based on reviews. This project is a spin off of RateMyProfessor with a social media aspect and basing the site more on courses rather than professors.
